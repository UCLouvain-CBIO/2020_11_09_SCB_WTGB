Poster for the Single Cell Biology conference by the Welcome Genome Campus 
(Hinxton, UK). The conference is held online, so the poster is submitted

the slide source code. 

The lightening talk was recorded with `SimpleScreenRecoerder` and edited
using `OpenShot`. The talk is available on Youtube:
