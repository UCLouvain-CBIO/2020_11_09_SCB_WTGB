Recent advances in sample preparation, processing and mass 
spectrometry have enabled the emergence of mass spec-based single-cell 
proteomics, or SCP. We have developed a computational framework by 
means of two Bioconductor packages to standardize SCP data analysis. 
The first package, scpdata, disseminates curated SCP data sets for 
method development and benchmarking. The second package, scp, 
implements functions to streamline the analysis of SCP data. Together, 
they will facilitate the development of dedicated algorithms, for 
instance to deal with missing data and batch effects that are 
characteristic of this type of data. The packages will also promote 
the reproducibility of further SCP data analyses.
